# Advanced Lecture : TypeScript, or how to learn something new

## Intro

The goal of this lecture is to see how and why we should learn new and adjacent skills. It is not the only way to learn, but if we give it a try, it could be surprisingly effective!

## Why ?

Why do we want to learn X ? Let's try to see the reasons:

- TypeScript: Interesting, job requirement, more robust, popular, employer like, popular
- TensorFlow & Machine Learning: Fun, Cool, maybe the future, robots, solve game problems, automation, accurate
- Python: Easy Syntax, Experience diff language, Monty Python, Another tool, Popular, Good with Data Science













### It's a Job Description

That's a bad idea, retention will probably be bad, motivation will be nil, and will be hard to sell to a future employer

### Solving a problem

That's probably a great idea! Approaching a previous problem with a new solution or way of working gives us context, reasons and motivation to learn.

### Curiosity 

That's great! Learning something for the sake of learning is also fun. However, it is hard to keep on track when it's vague and there is no 'true' reason to do it.
